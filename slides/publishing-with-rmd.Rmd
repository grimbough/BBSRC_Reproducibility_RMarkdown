## Bioconductor Workflows

- Educational documents detailing how to use multiple packages
- Regularly checked on Bioconductor servers
    - Ensures changes in component tools are identified quickly
    - Allows rapid updates by author
    - Provides users a platform to easily access the complete suite of tools
- Difficult to get credit 
    
## F1000Research

- F1000Research provides a citable, peer-reviewed publication platform
- Intention is for the same document to be submitted to both platforms - updates are possible

## BiocWorkflowTools

biocLite("BiocWorkflowTools")
```

    - Lab book / journal recording
    - Reports
    - Supplementary materials
    
- As a princple document for journal articles - we're not there yet!
