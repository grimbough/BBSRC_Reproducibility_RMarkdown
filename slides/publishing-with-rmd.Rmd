## Where to put analysis code with a publication

- GitHub Pages
- Bookdown / RStudio Connect / RPubs
- Binder / Jupyter Notebook Viewer
- Leanpub
- Hypothes.is

Self publishing is great, but doesn't get traditional academic credit


## Options for publishing code

Four existing models I am aware of:

- Rmarkdown to Overleaf to F1000Research (more on this)
- Jupyter Notebook as Supplement
- Embedded CodeOcean “capsule”
- eLife & Stencila

## Bioconductor Workflows

- Educational documents detailing how to use multiple packages
    - https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Workflow
- Regularly checked on Bioconductor servers
    - Ensures changes in component tools are identified quickly
    - Allows rapid updates by author
    - Provides users a platform to easily access the complete suite of tools
- Difficult to get credit 
    
## F1000Research

- F1000Research provides a citable, peer-reviewed publication platform
- Intention is for the same document to be submitted to both platforms 
- Updates are possible

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='25%', fig.align='right', fig.env=op }
knitr::include_graphics('f1000-revisions.png')
```

## Ideal scenario

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('publishing-pipeline.png')
```

## BiocWorkflowTools

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install("BiocWorkflowTools")
```

## Workflow

- Use BiocWorkflowTools to create a 'Workflow R package'
  - `BiocWorkflowTools::createBiocWorkflow(path = "Myworkflow")`
- Write a single Rmd vignette for both platforms
- Submit package to Bioconductor
- Use `uploadToOverleaf()` to begin journal submission


## In Overleaf

- Once rendered into Latex, the code chunks cannot be changed
- Can do minor editing of text BUT need to also edit Rmd source in parallel
- Submit to F1000Research button
- Incorporating editor revisions is challenging!

## Conclusions

- R Markdown is great for:
    - Lab book / journal recording
    - Reports
    - Supplementary materials
    
- As a primary document for journal articles - we're not there yet!
