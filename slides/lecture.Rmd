## Literate Programming & Live Documents

> "The main idea is to regard a program as a communication to human beings rather than as a set of instructions to a computer." - Donald Knuth

- Combines ‘human readable’ prose with source code and output in a single document
- Analyses can be more easily understood and reproduced

### Replicability vs Reproducibility

- Can you get my results from my data?

## Motivating example

- How often do you have code/ideas/figures spread across multiple files?
- An example
    - https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-208
- Look at Supplementary File 2

## What is Markdown?

- Lightweight markup language
- Write text and 'tag' elements for formatting later
    - Similar to LaTeX or HTML, but much simpler
- Can be used to create many types of output

## What is R Markdown?

- Basically **R** + Markdown
- You can include blocks of code 

## What is R Markdown?

- You can include blocks of code 

- Allows you to keep in a single document:
    - Code 
    - Explanatory text
    - Output e.g. tables, figures

## R Code Chunks

- `example_2-codechunks.Rmd`

## Introducing R Notebooks

- Consider always using R Markdown!
    - If you're going to write a script, make it Rmd
- Treat writing code like a lab book

## `sessionInfo()`

- Just because you can run a script later, doesn't mean it gives the same answers!
    - R changes
    - Packages change
    - Locale settings etc
