You can copy and paste the following code into an R session to install the packages 
required for the first R Markdown session.

```r
install.packages(c('knitr', 'rmarkdown'))
```

For the material covered in the parallel session you will need a few extra packages:

```r
install.packages(c('rticles', 'prereg', 'DT', 'kableExtra', 'bookdown', 'dplyr', 'ggplot2'))
```
